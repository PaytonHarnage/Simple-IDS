# Simple Intrustion Detection System (IDS)
This project implements a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python to monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activities. The IDS detects signs of potential security threats, such as unusual traffic patterns or brute force attemtps. and generates alerts when anomalies are detected. This project is designed as an educational tool to showchase the principles of network security and traffic analysis. 

# Key Features
* Traffic Monitoring: Continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious patterns
* Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusal activity like frequent login attempts or abnormal packet sizes that could indicate an attack
* Alert Generation: Logs anad alerts the user about potential intrustions via email or command line
* Customizable: Allows for easy additon of new rules and attack patterns to monitor
